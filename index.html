                                <p>My story of when we first met is too interesting to not share so here, I got rlly intimidated by her at first for no reason even tho we didnt talk</p>
                                <p>We had a pretty deep convo cuz my friend wanted to ask her if she’s together with the person she had a crush on, </p>
                                <p>Mind u, we rlly never ever talked to each other or interacted at all but i didnt get too shy to talk to her since it was just online, she ended up telling me bout the person she actually liked and i was rlly struggling on thinking what to say to her.</p>
                                <p>A while after that, we talked a lil more and got closer </p>
                                <p>My feeling of intimidation to her got less over time, especially when i heard her tiny voice (=^▽^)σ</p>
                                <p>We were supposed to meet irl on a convention before she leaves the country but my mom forgot to buy the tickets (c" ತ,_ತ) buckets of tears were spent that day</p>

                                <p>My bestest friend that made this whole website for me W(0)W. As u can see already from this whole thing he’s very very good at making sites (commissions would be most welcomed wjshjjw) and rlly good at playing piano too i mean rlly rlly rlly good </p>                            
                                <p>Even tho he’s all of that he still thinks negatively about himself most of the time, a bit of a pessimistic guy (´ー｀) </p>
                                <p>He’s my most closest friend and the only one im not pressured on making good jokes on cuz as i said earlier im bad at jokes ( TT)＼(^-^ ) </p>
                                <p>He helped me a lot with my art before when i was rlly rlly bad T-T man i thought that just doodling was practicing art, and even still now i ask him for help</p>
                                <p>We first met in genshin during Baal’s banner, he’s a real huge simp for raiden cuz he even had the courage to talk to strangers to farm for her weapon on other worlds. He kept hitting me with the fishing rod and since i only befriend those who i think r interesting, we became friends since then</p>
                                <p>I befriended him cuz he was interesting but stayed cuz he’s honest (brutally sometimes) </p>
